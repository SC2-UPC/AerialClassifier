# ImageClassifier

Implementation of CNN using Tensorflow for a ImageClassifier

## How does it work?

The idea is to use pre-classified images to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to classify later images.
### Prerequisites

In order to run the project you need:

```
- Python 2.7 or 3.5
- Tensorflow
```
